# Needhogg
App made as my final project for the course of "Angular app development" from the EOI (Escuela de origanizaci√≥n industrial).
The purpose of the app is to create a web using ffxiv api (https://xivapi.com/) to display mounts and minions from the game, as well as a formulary to send questions.

The formulary is not operational, only made for testing purposes.
